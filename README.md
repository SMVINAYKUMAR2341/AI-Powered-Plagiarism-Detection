# AI-Powered Plagiarism Detection: A Web-Based System for Text Integrity

This repository contains the source code and resources for a web-based plagiarism detection system that leverages AI/ML models to analyze text at the **paragraph level**. It is designed to provide real-time detection using **semantic similarity techniques**, dynamic web querying, and detailed heatmap-based reports.

## Project Highlights

-  **Paragraph-Level Analysis**
-  **Real-Time Web Search via Google APIs**
-  **AI & ML-based Detection using Sentence-BERT**
-  **Similarity Scoring using Cosine Similarity**
-  **Flask Web Interface for Document Uploads**

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/SMVINAYKUMAR2341/AI-Powered-Plagiarism-Detection.git
cd AI-Powered-Plagiarism-Detection
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Replace the API keys and search engine ID**<br>
Because this project uses google's search API, it requires an API key and a search engine ID. These are hardcoded in the model itself so we recomend that you add your keys in 'model.py', line 77 & 78.
```
....
results = {}
api_key = # Replace with your API key 
cx = # Replace with your search engine ID

print(f"Total paragraphs: {len(paragraphs)}")
....
```   
5. **Run the App**<br>
Within the folder, open your command prompt/terminal, and run the following:

```
export FLASK_APP=app
flask run
```

5. **Visit**<br>
Click the link that opens up within the browser.
Eg.
```
`http://localhost:5000`
```
